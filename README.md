# ballsack

![alt tag](ballsackScreenShot.jpg)

Two ways to use ballsack:

Interactive mode:
drag out circles (balls)
draw a circle around existing circles (sack)
repeat!

Xml File Visualizer:
Drag and drop an xml file into the window
On drop, ballsack will visualize the xml doc as balls and sacks

Notes: You can resize the window and press backspace to clear,
but you can't scale or position anything dragged in ...yet.
